## Challenge: Reviewing a README
Review this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/149TuP677pWp9I_rYhbwm08lIs9orcQ9a/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">README</a> and identify what you think are the key details to include in a README when describing a research project. Think about why they might be important details. 

## Solution
This README lists the researchers who received funding, basic funding information, basic descriptions of files in the dataset. This README is an example of how a README can be used to give a basic description of a research project. 

### Documentation with READMEs
READMEs are commonly used to document software installation, and can also be used for:
- Research project workflows
- Describing datasets

READMEs are typically a .txt or .md (markdown) file format
- These file formats can be opened universally

What to Include in a README?
- Title of research project and/or dataset
- Names, contact information, and institutional affiliation for those associated with the project
- Funding sources or institutional support
- A list of files and folders, a description of their contents, how to use them
- For each file name, a short list of the data that it contains
- The date that the file was created
